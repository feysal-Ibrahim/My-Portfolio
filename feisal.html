        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>It's really nice to have you here, feel free to take a tour of my React.js based site and learn more about my projects.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>My name is Peter and I'm a Front End developer who loves to create with code and color awesome web apps. I started my web journey around 2011 with HTML and CSS. During the years I went through a several Online Courses on Udemy.com and Treehouse.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>My goal was to get better and better in Code, I tried out a few languages like PHP, Ruby, Python and a few Front-end frameworks. It is not bad to know a basic understanding of how the web and Databases work but I know now my place is in a Front End.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I created this site and my social pages to shear with you all my projects and experience, if you like it I would love to hear from you.</p>
